**Movie Randomizer**

The objective of this project is to use the MovieDB API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to give movie or tv show suggestions based on the user's chosen genre. This also displays the different movies or tv shows from the API.

The site can also be accessed with this link https://movie-suggestion.netlify.app/
